Completion Instructions
Functionality to be added

The app must have the following functionalities

The speed should initially be 0mph

Here mph means Miles per hour

If the speed is less than 200mph, the speed should be increased by 10mph
If the speed is equal to 200mph, the speed should not be increased
When Apply Brake button is clicked

If the speed is greater than 0mph, then the speed should be decreased by 10mph
If the speed is equal to 0mph, the speed should not be decreased

Things to Keep in Mind
All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.
Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
Do not remove the pre-filled code
